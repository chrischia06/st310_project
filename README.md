Group Project for the [ST310 course](#https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST310.htm) .The aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques learnt in the ST310 Machine Learning module. We rely on both linear (Logistic Regression) and non-linear methods (Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) for a classification problem.

The final notebook is available at [](#)
